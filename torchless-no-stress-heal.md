**Strategy**
<br>
Step 1: Pray for run to get off the ground
<br>
Step 2: Git Gud
<br>
Step 3: Don't throw
<br>

Once a run gets going, prioritize: BV, hells hairpin, legendary bracer, and book of sanity in the beginning. For districts depending on how many crests have been saved up build a puppet theater or cartographers camp first. Try to do one veteran boss relatively early around week 30ish to get a 2nd blueprint to build a bank. Kill Miller around this time too in order to start building a shard mercenary team for endless harvest. Endless harvest serves a dual purpose of earning gold and getting shards for Farmstead items without burning weeks. All the while going on as many Antiquarian runs as possible.
<br>

Towards the late game once heroes are getting to lvl 5, start taking them to champion CC wine maker reserve missions to level the heroes to 6 in order to avoid torchless champion missions. Once there are enough dodge trinkets and a team available, start farming Sleeper ($40k runs) as often as possible in order to get an economy going. When preparing for DD, turn DD roster into vampires for speed and dmg buffs.

Key Items:
- 4x Camo cloaks for CC and Farmstead
- 4x Moon cloaks for normal dungeon clearing
- 1x hells hairpin, BV, Demons Cauldron (ideally vial of sand)
- 1x smoking skull, ashen distillation, mirror shield
- 3x Moon rings for DD maps
- 1x virtual ring for DD maps
- 1x idol/dark crown for DD maps

Milestones:
- **Weeks 5-8**: Typically one death around this time (luck runs out). After week 8, should have enough trinkets to tackle dungeons consistently without having to escape.
  
- **Weeks 15-18**: Typically one death around this time (overconfidence?). End of early game and beginning of mid game.Should start tackling Apprentice bosses and opening up farmstead/CC around this time.

- **Week 30ish**: Kill a veteran boss and Miller.
  
- **Week 40-50**: Typically deaths around this time. Tail end of mid game, should be preparing teams for DD and late game. Clearing veteran bosses around this time.
